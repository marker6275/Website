const Website = () => {
    return (    
        <div className="py-5">
            <h1 className="text-5xl mb-5">Template</h1>
            <hr className="mb-5"/>
            This was a really real probject and I worked on it really hard. I created this with real frameworks and code and I wrote all the code and it was pretty fun.

            Without any help, I drew everything
            There wasn't too much to do but it was nice.
        </div>
    )
}

export default Website;
