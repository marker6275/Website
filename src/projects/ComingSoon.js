                So that's it for now :(

                If you're reading this then it probably means you think my projects are cool :D (or at least I hope so) but I think I'm going to just be putting projects that I've worked on along with a little description. 
                There's lots of things I want to create and I'll list them down below. 
                It's likely that I've already started and just haven't completed them so come back another time and maybe this list will expand.

                I don't exactly know what I want to do with this website, but it is really fun to add to and work on.
                I think I'm likely to just end up putting any of my homework assignments that are cool or I think were interesting (or more likely the ones that took the most work).

                I'd love to create a chatbot that helps with translation and language learning. I've thought into it a little but with Twilio messaging and the ChatGPT API, but other than that I don't really have anything for it yet.

                Something else I'd love to build would be a sports betting algorithm that could more accurately predict sports games, but this would involve large data sets,
                and I have started working on it but probably want to hold off on it until I know what I'm doing. But since I am interested in machine learning and AI,
                this is something I'm going to revisit eventually.

                My biggest goals here would just be to improve the UI, since a lot of how this website looks is really bland and old-school,
                which is mostly what I had in mind when I created it but I think I definitely enjoy the modern look much more.

                First would probably be to make the header navbar look nicer, then add more animations. 
                Then, I want to do a lot of file cleanup, such as making separate json files for all the info. 
                Eventually, I hope I can put all the info into AWS or some other database so that there's no json files anymore. 
                I don't exactly know how that would work or how much it may cost (hopefully nothing) but that's something for the future.
